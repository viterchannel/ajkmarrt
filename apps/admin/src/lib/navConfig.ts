/**
 * Single source of truth for the admin sidebar navigation.
 *
 * Extracted from `components/layout/AdminLayout.tsx` so it can be reused
 * by the command palette, breadcrumb generator, the in-sidebar search
 * filter, and any new "favorites/pinned" UI without having to import the
 * heavy layout file.
 *
 * Each `NavGroup` has:
 *   - `key`              — stable string id used for persistence (collapsed
 *                          state, pinned ordering). Independent from i18n.
 *   - `labelKey`         — TranslationKey for the group header.
 *   - `color`            — accent colour for the active-state pill +
 *                          group dot.
 *   - `items`            — array of { nameKey, href, icon, optional badges }.
 *
 * Adding a new route? Add it here and it will appear in the sidebar AND in
 * any consumer (command palette item index, breadcrumbs, favorites star
 * picker) automatically.
